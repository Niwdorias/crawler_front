Introduction
Welcome to the Front End Documentation
Welcome to the documentation for the Front End of our Web Crawler project! This front-end application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Web Crawler Backend. It enables users to initiate web scraping processes, view results, and manage crawled data effortlessly.

About the Web Crawler
Our Web Crawler project consists of both a Backend and this Front End. The Backend handles the scraping of web content, storing data in a database, and providing API endpoints. The Front End serves as the user interface, allowing users to input URLs, set scraping parameters, and retrieve and display the crawler's outcomes.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: The front-end application offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the web crawler.

URL Input: Users can input target URLs and specify the depth of the crawling process.

Results Display: The front end displays the outcomes of the crawling process in a visually pleasing and structured manner.

Data Management: Users can manage crawled data, including viewing, updating, and re-running the crawler for existing URLs (bonus feature).

Getting Started
Before you dive into using our Front End application, it's essential to understand its functionalities and how it complements the Web Crawler Backend. This documentation will guide you through the installation, configuration, and usage of the front-end application.

Table of Contents
Here's an overview of the sections covered in this documentation:

Installation: Instructions on setting up the front-end application on your local development environment or web server.

Configuration: Details on any configuration options available within the front-end application, including API endpoint settings.

User Guide: A comprehensive user guide on how to use the front-end application to interact with the web crawler backend.


Compatibility
Our Front End is designed to work seamlessly with the Web Crawler Backend, which is built using Laravel and MongoDB. Ensure that you have the backend service up and running before integrating the front end.

Feedback
Your feedback is valuable to us! If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out me by email.

Now, let's begin with the installation process to set up the Front End and start harnessing the power of our Web Crawler project.
Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide to installing and setting up an Angular project from GitHub:

Step 1: Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js and npm: Angular requires Node.js and npm. You can download and install them from the official website.
Step 2: Clone the GitHub Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command, replacing <repository_url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone:


git clone <repository_url>

Example:

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
This will create a new folder in your current directory with the name of the repository.

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change your current directory to the newly created project folder using the cd command. Replace <project_folder_name> with the name of the folder created during cloning:

cd <project_folder_name>
Step 4: Install Angular CLI
If you haven't already installed the Angular CLI globally, you can do so using npm. Run the following command:


npm install -g @angular/cli
This installs the Angular CLI globally on your system.

Step 5: Install Project Dependencies
Inside the project directory, you should see a package.json file that lists the project's dependencies.

Run the following command to install these dependencies:


npm install
This will download and install all the required packages and libraries for the Angular project.

Step 6: Serve the Angular Application
To start the development server and run the Angular application locally, use the Angular CLI's ng serve command:


ng serve
By default, the application will be available at http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser.

If you want to specify a different port, you can use the -port flag like this:

bash
Copy code
ng serve --port 8080
Step 7: Accessing the Application
Open your web browser.

Go to http://localhost:4200/ (or the custom port you specified) to access and interact with the Angular application.


GOOD Luck!!!!
